Actually it's a small mod now, maybe more to come... I have a WordPress customizer add on that enables you to create your own footer text to replace the standard copyright one (but we still give Anders Noren credit below). For example, you might use it to insert a creative commons license statement.

## Installing

First, use the standard WordPress Appearances -> Themes to find and install the [Hitchcock theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/hitchcock/).

Next, install the Kid Hitchock theme [downloaded from this repo as a .zip file](https://github.com/cogdog/kid-hitchcock/archive/master.zip); either by uploading to your wp-content/themes directory or by direct FTPing the unzipped files to your wordpress `wp-content/theme`s directory.

Then activate the theme! Build content! Go to the Customizer to kid around with your footer.
